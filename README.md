## Overview
This project targets **SemEval-2024 Task 6 (SHROOM)**: detecting fluent but factually incorrect ("hallucinated") text generated by LLMs.
The core challenge was working with **Unlabeled Data**. I developed a **Teacher-Student framework** using Mistral-7B to generate pseudo-labels, which were then used to train a robust ensemble of DeBERTa and CatBoost.

## 🚀 Key Techniques
*   **Pseudo-Labeling (Semi-Supervised):** Used **Mistral-7B** via zero-shot prompting to create synthetic labels for the training set.
*   **Hybrid Ensemble:** Combined a Deep Learning approach (mDeBERTa-v3) with a Feature-Based approach (CatBoost with lexical overlap features).
*   **Confidence Filtering:** Implemented a thresholding logic to only train on "High Confidence" pseudo-labels, reducing noise.
