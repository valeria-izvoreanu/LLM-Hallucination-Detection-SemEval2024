### The Problem: Silent Failures in LLMs
Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate "fluent but false" information (Hallucinations). In enterprise RAG systems, these errors are dangerous.
**The Challenge:** Detecting these errors usually requires massive labeled datasets, which are expensive and slow to create.

### The Solution
We built a **Semi-Supervised Pipeline** that achieves high detection accuracy **without** needing a fully labeled training set. We use a "Teacher-Student" architecture where a large model creates training data for a smaller, efficient classifier.

##  Architecture & Methodology

### 1. The "Teacher": Zero-Shot Pseudo-Labeling
We used **Mistral-7B** (via Zero-Shot Prompting) to act as a "Teacher."
*   We fed it unlabelled text and asked it to identify hallucinations.
*   While Mistral is not perfect, it provided enough "Pseudo-Labels" to bootstrap the training process.

### 2. The "Student": Model Fine-Tuning
We used the synthetic data generated by Mistral to fine-tune a smaller, faster model: **DeBERTa-v3**.
*   **Why DeBERTa?** It is significantly lighter than a GPT model, making it suitable for real-time production monitoring of hallucinations.
*   **Ensemble Strategy:** We combined the DeBERTa output with **CatBoost** (Gradient Boosting) to capture both semantic and statistical features of the text.

## Key Results
*   **Data Efficiency:** Successfully trained a robust detector using largely unlabeled data.
*   **Performance:** The ensemble model achieved **73% Accuracy** in distinguishing between fluent text and hallucinations, outperforming the baseline by **14%**.
*   **Real-World Application:** This pipeline proves that companies can build "Safety Monitors" for their AI products without spending months manually labeling data.
